<h1>Welcome</h1>
<div>
    <p>
    <b>Wait</b>, no. You'd rather be at <a
        href="https://watsi.org/">Watsi</a> and help some people out, or
    sign up for <a href="https://www.google.com/onetoday/">giving up a
        dollar a day</a> if you are looking for an easier way to help.
    </p>

    <p>Here's a few more people that you should consider giving to:

    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.radiolab.org/">RadioLab</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/">This American
            Life</a></li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    It's not that there's no one else out there, that deserves your money
    more - these are the causes I identify with personally, the most.

    I am Sandesh. My resume is a bit out of date, and I am too lazy to
    update it. I shall put it up exactly <em>here</em> when I am done
    updating it.
    </p>

    <p>
    I really have no long-running hobbies. I try different things at
    different times - these days, I hike most weekends in the bay area,
    and try weird yoga poses when I am at home. I listen to a lot of
    music - again, nothing specific. It's ghazals or instrumentals early
    in the morning - deep, thumping instrumentals (think Hans Zimmer)
    during the day - and an ecelectic mix in the evening. The
    Shins, Mumford and Sons, some classic rock, old Bollywood songs.
    I've got me a pair of <a href="http://www.vanatoo.com/">Vanatoos</a>
    to listen to all of this.
    </p>

    <p>
    At work, I love improving products that people use. As soon as my
    employers let me, I'll let you know what that is! Perhaps my resume
    will tell you the work I have done in the past. Once it is up, that
    is.
