        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
            Wait, no. You'd rather be at Watsi, or sign up for giving up a dollar a
            day to Google.
            </p>

            <p>Here's a few more people that you should consider giving to:

            <ul>
                <li>RadioLab</li>
                <li>This American Life</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
            It's not that there's no one else out there, that deserves your money
            more - these are the causes I identify with personally, the most.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h1>About me</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
            Here's my resume. There's a plain text version, and a pdf
            version, that <em>may</em> be out of date.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
            I don't do social networks, but I do like to reserve the
            namespace. You may find me on:
            <ul>
                <li>Facebook</li>
                <li>Twitter</li>
                <li>Google+</li>
                <li>LinkedIn</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <h1>Get out of here ...</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
            ... and on to one of these pages:
            <ul>
                <li>Dhruv's blog</li>
            </ul>
