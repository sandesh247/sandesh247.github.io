<h1>Welcome</h1>
<div>
    <p>
    <b>Wait</b>, no. You'd rather be at <a
        href="https://watsi.org/">Watsi</a> and help some people out, or
    sign up for <a href="https://www.google.com/onetoday/">giving a
        dollar a day</a> if you are looking for an easier way to help.
    </p>

    <p>Here's a few more people that you might consider giving to:

    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.radiolab.org/">RadioLab</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/">This American
            Life</a></li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    I can't really speak for any of these charities - you should
    evaluate them yourselves before you decide to put your good money in
    them. These are simply the ones I choose to give to.

    I am Sandesh. My resume is a bit out of date, and I am too lazy to
    update it. I shall put it up exactly <em>here</em> when I am done
    updating it.
    </p>

    <p>
    I currently live in Sunnyvale, and work in Mountain View.
    I trust spam filters enough to tell you that my email address is
    <a
        href="mailto:sandesh247+website@gmail.com">sandesh247@gmail.com</a>.
    And you may call me at + 1 347 687 7748. I much prefer email,
    though.

    <p>
    I really have no long-running hobbies. I try different things at
    different times - these days, I {b,h}ike most weekends in the bay
    area, and try weird yoga poses when I am at home. I listen to a lot
    of music - again, nothing specific. It's ghazals or instrumentals
    early in the morning - deep, thumping instrumentals (think Hans
    Zimmer) during the day - and an ecelectic mix in the evening. The
    Shins, Mumford and Sons, some classic rock, old Bollywood songs.
    I've got me a pair of <a href="http://www.vanatoo.com/">Vanatoos</a>
    to listen to all the music.
    </p>

    <p>
    At work, I love improving products that people use. As soon as my
    employers let me, I'll let you know what that is! Perhaps my resume
    will tell you the work I have done in the past. Once it is up, that
    is.

    I also have some bookmarks on Google, but I am not sure how to share
    them. If you have any idea how might I share them, let me know.
    Actually, I might have to migrate these bookmarks to a new place,
    just to be able to do that. Will save that for later.
