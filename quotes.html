    <em>Dhruv Matani</em>
    <blockquote>
        I believe there are always 2 phases in one's life ... the
        exploratory phase and the focus stage, as you put so well. Both need
        to take place alternatively in a continued fashion for the continued
        growth of that individial. If any one stops, then the individual
        stops growing / learning.

        professional activities. Training is what you do to dogs. What
        you should be doing with people is educating them, not training
        them. There is a big, big difference ...

    <blockquote>
        I really hate this damned machine;<br />
        I wish that they would sell it.<br />

        But only what I tell it.<br />
